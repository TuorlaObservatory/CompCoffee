# Getting ready: macOS


## Homebrew
MacOS has its own (unofficial) package manager called homebrew. Most, if not all, the things presented here can be installed using it. See [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) for installation guide.

## Brewing
Using homebrew is easy. To install package named `xxx` use
```
brew install xxx
```
Simple and easy!
