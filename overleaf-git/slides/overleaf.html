    # Overleaf

    ### A web-based `\(\LaTeX{}\)` and Rich Text collaborative writing/publishing tool

    -->

    # What is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)?

    --

    - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) provides an on-line in-browser `\(\LaTeX\)` editor with some cloud storage for your files
    
    ???
      Overleaf works through browser, provides some storage for a project

    --

    - A great number of paper templates with pre-defined journal styles (e.g. MNRAS)
    

    ???
      Library of templates for various journals - just one click away. Can be handy instead of looking for a specific .sty or .bst file

    --

    - A tool to send your paper to a desired publisher directly from [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
    
    ???
      Standard papers can be submited to the journal right from Overleaf

    --
      
    - History of recently made changes  

    ???
      Keeps track of recent small changes. Can create versions - snapshots of your project at some point. You can go back to these versions.
    
    --

    - Options for collaboration - you can share a link to a project with collaborators to allow them to view and edit your work
      - You can see which person did which changes

    ???
      Easy sharing of the project with supervisor/team; simultaneous online editing allowed

    
    --

    - Git-compatible API. Makes it possible to work on your paper without using browser, following standard git cycle:
    ```
    git pull
    *make changes*
    git add ...
    git commit -m "very_informative_message"  
    git push
    ```

    ???
      Of course, git access. It is better than web-editor, because browsers are slow and laggy. And you can edit without internet

    --

    - It only supports one remote branch (**master**)
    
    ???
      Remote repository supports only one git branch (for now?)

    # More features

    --

    - Side-by-side `\(\LaTeX\)` source and output PDF

    ???
      Nothing special, but still shows you both LaTeX and output PDF simultaneously

    --

    - PDFs are generated either on demand, or in automatic mode - after a change was made

    ???
      Different regimes of PDF deneration (Manual/Auto). Can be reaaaaalllyyy sloowww if lots of small changes are made

    --
    
    - Web editor supports go-to: you can e.g. jump from paragraph in PDF to respective `\(\LaTeX\)` text

    ???
      Useful for "debugging" LaTeX source. Click paragraph/item on PDF which caused the error - and you get respective source code    

    --

    - Same thing works with compilation errors - you can easily find error in your source

    ???
      Highlights all errors

    --

    - Rich text mode converts source `\(\LaTeX\)` to WYSIWYG\*-like text in real-time
      - [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)\* - *<b>W</b>hat <b>Y</b>ou <b>S</b>ee <b>I</b>s <b>W</b>hat <b>Y</b>ou <b>G</b>et*, text layout one can see in Word and similar text processors
    
    ???
      Not really useful, converts LaTeX source to Word-like text. Can make it more comfortable for Word-people

    --

    - **Paid feature** - for $12/month ($6/month for students) you get full project history (can be useful), protected projects (like private repositories on GitHub), and priority technical support (not really needed)

    ???
      I actually use this - because I want protected repos. Almost all features are available for free (including git). Git commit history is waaay better than full project history.

      Fourth slide
    -->
  
    # Share`\(\LaTeX\)`

    --

    - Share`\(\LaTeX\)` is yet another tool for online collaborative `\(\LaTeX\)` editing. 

    ???
      ShareLaTeX is there, but it is to be consumed by Overleaf

    --

    - Its web editor has even more useful features, than Overleaf

    ???
      Editor has more advanced features that eventually will come to Overleaf editor. But we can use local editors and git system with that

    --

    - However, recently Overleaf acquired Share`\(\LaTeX\)` and now they are now combining two platforms into one powerful tool
