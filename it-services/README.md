# First: CSC in a nutshell

- Founded in 1971 as a technical support unit for *Univac 1108*

- CSC connected Finland to the Internet in 1988

- Datacenter in Kajaani started in 2012
    - home of supercomputers *Sisu* and *Taito*

- Services require a CSC account
    - available free of charge for researchers at higher education institutions in Finland

# Computational resources: *Sisu* & *Taito*

## **Sisu**
- Supercomputer with 40k cores
- Large-scale parallel computations which require exceptionally powerful supercomputing resources
- From several hundreds to up to thousands of cores

## **Taito**
- Supercluster (CPUs + GPUs)
- General-purpose technical and scientific computing 
- Single core jobs to parallel jobs of several hundred cores

# Grid computing

- Grid computing enables applying the resources of many computers or computing clusters in a network to a single problem at the same time

- Finnish Grid Infrastructure:
    - *Titan* (@Turku) 260 cores (10 nodes + 1 largemem node)
    - *Pleione* (@Turku) 793 cores (18 nodes + 16 largemem nodes)
